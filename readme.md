# Portfolio #
This is my very first coding portfolio, designed to showcase my abilities thus far.

## What does that mean? ##
Well, I used basic HTML and CSS to design a modest looking webpage that has some basic information about myself, as well as links to projects (Coming Soon). 
The user can interact with both the links on the top of the page to navigate within the webpage, as well as the images to be redirected to the websites.
